Reddit r/place but in minecraft

This is a plugin to do the famous Reddit r/place event but in minecraft. You have a ready to run server directly in release.
This plugin implements a full login system into a postgresql database. Before running the server, you need to install postgres in your server. Then, you have to run the reset_database.bat file in order to setup the database. If you run the server under linux, create a reset_database.sh file inspired by the reset_database.bat. You can then start the server.
